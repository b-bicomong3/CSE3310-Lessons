# CSE3310 Recursive Algorthm Notes

## Merge Sort

Merge sort follows a divide and conquer method of sorting, where the array is split into its base length and then
rebuilt by combining progressively larger sorted lists together. The recursive portion is the splitting of the list and
the iterative portion is the actual merging of the two smaller sorted lists into a single larger sorted list.

Often times, this function is separated into splitting and merging functions.
